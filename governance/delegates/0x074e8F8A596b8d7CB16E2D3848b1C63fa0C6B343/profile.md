Hello im Daniel,

I am a mission driven individual with a commitment to creating greater prosperity for the world. I have spent the last 20 + years in my business and political roles bringing people together behind a "vision of the future" to drive change and deliver objectives. 

I am fascinated by the digital opportunities of web 3.0 and blockchain to create greater wealth, freedom and opportunity for people to achieve their full potential, creating and serving others more. Outside of my business and political roles, i enjoy reading, yoga, travelling and great coffee and food! I love to meet people and understand their thinking and views of the world.
